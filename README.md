# Maximum Increasing Subarray
Author: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

## Problem Description
Given an unordered array of _k_ integers, find the largest subarray **a** such that **a** is an increasing subarray. That is, that every element in **a** is greater than or equal to the preceeding element. 

>[!Note]
>There are two approaches to this problem: iterative and recursive. This project in its current state only contains the iterative solution.

## Iterative Solution
The current .cpp file contains the iterative solution.
